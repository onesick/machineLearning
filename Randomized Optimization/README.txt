For this assignment, there are two parts of code to run both files are located in directory of Randomized Optmization in github.com/onesick/machinelearning repo

Set up:
after cloning from the repo, run, 
```
conda env update -f requirements.yml
```
I am assuming you already installed conda, and knows how to activate environments.


1. working with three different problems to optmize using 4 different randomized optimization technique
```
python TravellingSales.py
```
to run the first part

2. Neural net analysis. I'm printing values to compare performances. 
```
python NueralNet.py
```
to run the second part of the assignment
